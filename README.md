This project extracts data from the lines of season 2 and its mention of various characters from the sitcom, "The Office". As the frequency of different characters are mentioned in each episode of The Office, the viewership changes. In other words, certain characters drew more viewership than others. Furthermore, the data shows that the there was a stronger liking to the show in the middle of the season, as opposed to the beginning and end of it. I used various libraries including dplyr, tidyr, tidytext, ggplot2, and schrute to complete this project.
